NAME
    TagmaDebug - Interactive TCL Debugger

SYNOPSIS
    tagmadebug.tcl <YourScript.tcl>

OPTIONS
    *NONE* Only takes a TCL script to be debugged.

DESCRIPTION
    TagmaDebug is a simple interactive debugger for TCL programs.

    When TagmaDebug starts it creates a trace on "__TagmaDebugMain." This
    procedure sources the script provided on the command line. The trace on
    this procedure basically causes a break on every command. Once the
    script completes the procedure "__TagmaDebugComplete" is called. There
    is a hidden enter trace on this procedure to ensure the user gets the
    debugger prompt one last time.

    All output from the debugger is written to stderr. This allows for
    redirection of the program or debugger output if desired.

COMMANDS
    There are a few interactive commands that control the debugger. There is
    no line editing and very little nicety.

    h or ?      Prints the help text.

    a or >      Prints the command being executed.

    p           Prints the current level & procedure. When at the top level
                '::' is printed for the procedure.

    e or [..]   Evaluates TCL code. When using [..] The closing ']' is
                required.

    !           Executes a shell command.

    =           Prints the content of each variable name proided.

    var log     Logs all modifications of a variable to stderr.

    var break   Adds breakpoint for writes to a variable.

    var info    Prints all variables being watched for.

    var clear   Clears logging and breaks for variables. Passes the variable
                to [string match ...] so globbing can be used.

    cmd enter   Set a break point for the entering of a command.

    cmd leave   Set a break point for the leaving of a command.

    cmd step    Steps through the command. Every command that is executed
                inside the command is a breakpoint.

    cmd clear   Clear break points. Passes the command to [string match ...]
                so globbing can be used.

    c or Enter  Continue execution. Change the variable "entercontinues" at
                the top of the script to "0" to disable Enter acting as
                continue.

    r           Restarts the program.

    v           Toggle verbosity. Print extra info, when available.

    x or q      Exit the debugger. Ctrl-D should also have the same effect.

PORTABILITY
    TagmaDebug should work with any TCL version 8.4 or later. Testing has
    thus far been limited to Tcl 8.5 under Cygwin on Windows 7.

INSTALLATION
    Either copy tagmadebug.tcl where you want it or run "make install".
