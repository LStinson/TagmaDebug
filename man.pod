TagmaDebug - Interactive TCL Debugger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

tagmadebug.tcl <YourScript.tcl>

=head1 OPTIONS

I<NONE> Only takes a TCL script to be debugged.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<TagmaDebug> is a simple interactive debugger for TCL programs.

When B<TagmaDebug> starts it creates a trace on "B<__TagmaDebugMain>." This
procedure sources the script provided on the command line. The trace on this
procedure basically causes a break on every command. Once the script completes
the procedure "B<__TagmaDebugComplete>" is called. There is a hidden enter
trace on this procedure to ensure the user gets the debugger prompt one last
time.

All output from the debugger is written to B<stderr>. This allows for
redirection of the program or debugger output if desired.

=head1 COMMANDS

There are a few interactive commands that control the debugger. There is no
line editing and very little nicety.

=over 12

=item B<h> or B<?>

Prints the help text.

=item B<a> or B<E<gt>>

Prints the command being executed.

=item B<p>

Prints the current level & procedure. When at the top level '::' is printed
for the procedure.

=item B<e> or B<[..]>

Evaluates TCL code. When using B<[..]> The closing ']' is required.

=item B<!>

Executes a shell command.

=item B<=>

Prints the content of each variable name proided.

=item B<var log>

Logs all modifications of a variable to stderr.

=item B<var break>

Adds breakpoint for writes to a variable.

=item B<var info>

Prints all variables being watched for.

=item B<var clear>

Clears logging and breaks for variables. Passes the variable to [string match
...] so globbing can be used.

=item B<cmd enter>

Set a break point for the entering of a command.

=item B<cmd leave>

Set a break point for the leaving of a command.

=item B<cmd step>

Steps through the command. Every command that is executed inside the command
is a breakpoint.

=item B<cmd clear>

Clear break points. Passes the command to [string match ...] so globbing can
be used.

=item B<c> or Enter

Continue execution. Change the variable "entercontinues" at the top of the
script to "0" to disable Enter acting as continue.

=item B<r>

Restarts the program.

=item B<v>

Toggle verbosity. Print extra info, when available.

=item B<x> or B<q>

Exit the debugger. Ctrl-D should also have the same effect.

=head1 PORTABILITY

B<TagmaDebug> should work with any TCL version 8.4 or later. Testing has thus
far been limited to Tcl 8.5 under Cygwin on Windows 7.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Either copy F<tagmadebug.tcl> where you want it or run "make install".
